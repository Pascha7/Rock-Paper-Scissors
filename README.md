# Rock-Paper-Scissors

By creating the rock paper scissors game in the browser console, I'll be learning the fundamentals of programming with JavaScript. Specifically, I'll learn about conditional statements and loops, which are key concepts in programming. These concepts will allow me to create the game logic and decide who wins and who loses based on the user's input. I'll also learn about event listeners, which will allow me to detect when the user interacts with the game and trigger the game logic accordingly.

Overall, creating the rock paper scissors game in the browser console is going to be a great way for me to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript programming and create an interactive game that can be played in the console.
